## 🎓 For Your Supervisor Demo

### Demo Flow (2-3 minutes):

1. **Show Connection** (30s)
   - "Here's the BlockMed dashboard"
   - Click "Connect MetaMask"
   - Show wallet connection

2. **Create Prescription** (60s)
   - Click "Create New Prescription"
   - Enter demo data
   - Submit to blockchain
   - Show MetaMask confirmation

3. **Show Results** (45s)
   - Display transaction hash
   - Show QR code
   - Scan with phone (optional but impressive!)

4. **Explain** (15s)
   - "This prescription is now immutably stored on the blockchain"
   - "The QR code can be used for verification"

### Key Talking Points:
- 🔒 **Security**: Blockchain ensures data integrity
- 🔗 **Transparency**: Every transaction is traceable
- 📱 **Convenience**: QR codes for easy sharing
- 🚀 **Scalability**: Ready for patient/pharmacy portals

---

## ⚠️ Critical Configuration

**BEFORE RUNNING THE APP:**

After deploying the contract, you **MUST** update this file:

📄 **`src/utils/config.js`**

```javascript
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'PASTE_YOUR_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS_HERE'
```

**How to get the address:**
1. Run `npm run blockchain` (Terminal 1)
2. Run `npm run deploy` (Terminal 2)
3. Copy the address from the output
4. Paste it in `config.js`

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "MetaMask not detected" | Install MetaMask extension |
| "Transaction failed" | Check you're on "Hardhat Local" network |
| "Invalid contract address" | Update `config.js` with deployed address |
| QR not showing | Wait for transaction to confirm |
| Can't connect wallet | Unlock MetaMask and refresh page |

**More help:** See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) Section "Troubleshooting"
